   For use cases such as sharing buffer in comint mode, it would be

   The status icon of users should be clickable. For example, when the

   location of the changes.
** TODO Keep a log of the current session

** TODO Always queue outgoing data
   + Components :: transport and protocol backends
   + Type :: task
   + Reporter :: jan
   + Assigned ::
   Large amounts of outgoing data freeze emacs (well, there is a

   sending would solve this problem
** TODO Add a queue monitor minor mode
   + Components :: user interface
   + Type :: task
   + Reporter :: jan
   + Assigned ::
   Queuing data before sending it has the disadvantage of allowing the
   queue to grow arbitrarily large if more outgoing data is generated
   than the link can handle. Therefore, there should be some
   indication of the amount of queued data.

   `rudel-header-subscriptions-minor-mode' displays users in the
