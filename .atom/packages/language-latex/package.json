Converted from the\n[Textmate bundle](https://github.com/textmate/latex.tmbundle)\n\n# About snippets\nSome features (e.g., [placeholder duplication](https://github.com/atom/snippets/issues/17)) are not yet implemented in Atom snippets management. It is for now impossible to reproduce some advanced coding. The majority of snippets have just been converted or simplified, a few are not property usable for now.\n",
